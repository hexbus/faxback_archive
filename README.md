# Welcome to the Unofficial RadioShack Faxback archive!

When RadioShack entered bankruptcy in 2015, their support.radioshack.com site eventually was decommissioned.  The site had manuals, datasheets, and much more for 20+ years of products.  

I have several archives of old Radio Shack Faxback documentation from the site, and this is going to be an open source effort to try and put these documents back online.  I do need development help to crawl through the archive to get these documents extracted correctly, so if you have great searching/parsing skills and would like to help, please drop me a tweet - @guidryjd.
